## The Story So Far...

I graduated in 2009 and was lucky enough to immediately find a great job, with pay, benefits, and a small amount of prestige. All of those things being immensely 
attractive to a recent college grad, I may have over looked exactly how this career opportunity would play with my recently gained nounce of expertise. Although
I am tremendously grateful for the once-in-a-life-time opportunities and learing experiences, a germ of dissatisfaction has taken root. Now, about 4 years into a 
moderately successful 'middle-manager' career track, I find my interest in solving technical problems slowly tipping the balance away from my interest in a stable 
and well compensated profession. 

## I want to solve problems.

My job requires a certain amount of interpersonal 'emotional IQ'-type skills. While I have not been unsucessful in gaining and applying those skills, it does leave
something to be desired. Something is missing in the professional experience. For lack of a better explanation, I miss tech! 

So, in an attempt to rebuild the technical skills I have, assuming a degree means anything these days, lost and gain some skills I think are important, I have started this tiny blog. I intend to chart and log progress, post small- perhaps helpful -projects, and write some succinct technical how-to's.

Here we go.
